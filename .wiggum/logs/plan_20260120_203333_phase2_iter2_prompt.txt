You are reviewing milestone files that were written to disk.

## Your Mission
Review the milestone breakdown using the Council of AIs (Gemini + Codex).

## Files to Review (absolute paths)
/Users/runyaga/dev/soliplex-flutter/wiggum.yaml


## Original Spec (absolute path)
/Users/runyaga/dev/soliplex-flutter/docs/planning/logging-architecture.md

## Previous Feedback (for context)
/Users/runyaga/dev/soliplex-flutter/milestones/COUNCIL_FEEDBACK.md

This file contains issues from the PREVIOUS review iteration.
Verify that ALL previously reported issues have been addressed.

## MANDATORY: Gemini Review

Call mcp__gemini__read_files with EXACTLY:
- file_paths: ["/Users/runyaga/dev/soliplex-flutter/wiggum.yaml","", "/Users/runyaga/dev/soliplex-flutter/docs/planning/logging-architecture.md", /Users/runyaga/dev/soliplex-flutter/milestones/COUNCIL_FEEDBACK.md]
- prompt: "Review this milestone breakdown. Your goals:
  1. Completeness - does it cover EVERYTHING in the spec? Nothing missing?
  2. Simplicity - is the approach simple and direct? Flag over-engineering.
  3. Architecture - are there better ways to structure this?
  4. Spec adherence - does the plan match the spec exactly? No scope creep?
  5. Structure - does each milestone have '## Success Criteria' (EXACT name, NOT '## Validation Gate') with FLAT checkboxes? (No ### subsections inside - the gate checker regex stops at ### headers!)
  6. If COUNCIL_FEEDBACK.md exists, verify ALL previous issues were addressed.

  You are catching lazy or off-spec planning. Implementation details are less important
  than ensuring the plan is complete, simple, and architecturally sound.

  REJECT any milestone that uses '## Validation Gate' instead of '## Success Criteria'.
  REJECT any milestone with ### subsections inside Success Criteria.

  Output <review>PASS</review> or <review>ISSUES: [specific list]</review>"

## Report Results

After BOTH reviews complete:
- If BOTH say PASS: <promise>APPROVED</promise>
- If EITHER has issues: <promise>ISSUES: [combined list from both]</promise>

DO NOT skip the reviews. DO NOT make up results. Actually call the tools.
